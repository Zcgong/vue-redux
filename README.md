# Vue + Redux :couple:
An example of showing how to implement [~~Flux~~](http://facebook.github.io/flux/) [Redux](https://github.com/gaearon/redux) into a [Vue.js](http://vuejs.org/) app.

## Thoughts :thought_balloon:
 + In Vue.js, to pass down props from parent to children, we need to treat the props as [data](http://vuejs.org/api/options.html#data). Then we have to state it explicitly in our template.
 
    ```html
    <items-view store="{{store}}"></items-view>
    ```
     *Where store is an object generated by Redux*.
 + Vue.js makes all data reactive. So our *store* and *actions* became Vue instance which inherit Vue native methods. Still hope to find a way to make it pure object.

## Run the app :computer:
This app is just a pretty simple task list app. But it shows that Redux is working with Vue.js. Nothing fancy, to run it
```
npm clone https://github.com/yang-wei/vue-flux.git 
npm install
npm run build
```
To watch with webpack hot module replacement :fire:
```
npm run hot
```

## Todo :memo:
 + Some css maybe ?
 + Extends this app to multiple pages
 + Unit testing

## Dev tools used :gun:
 + webpack (and it's dev server)
 + babel for es6 

## What about the pure Flux?
I start to experiment this with the pure Flux. You can still find it on [flux branch](https://github.com/yang-wei/vue-flux/tree/flux) or [here](https://github.com/yang-wei/vue-flux/releases/tag/v0.0.1)

## Vuex
Recently, the creator of Vue.js created [Vuex](https://github.com/vuejs/vuex) which is a library to enable Vue.js adopt Flux-like architecture. 
Have a look if you're interested =)
